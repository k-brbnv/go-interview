This code implementing a thread-safe cache using a distributed hash table. 
The goal is to allow concurrent access to a cache where multiple goroutines can safely read and write to the cache without race conditions. 
Each key-value pair is stored in one of several buckets (implemented as a slice of data structs), with the bucket chosen based on a hash function. 
This technique is commonly used to improve performance by allowing more concurrent operations.

_Explanation:_

**Cache Interface:**
The Cache interface defines the basic operations:
Set(k, v string): Adds a key-value pair to the cache.
Get(k string) (v string, ok bool): Retrieves the value associated with the key k.

**Bucketized Cache:**
The cache struct holds a slice of data structs ([]data), each representing a bucket. 
Each data struct contains a map (mapa) for storing key-value pairs and a sync.RWMutex to handle concurrent access.

**Set Operation:**
The key k is hashed using the Hash(k) function to determine which bucket it belongs to (i = i % len(c.data)). 
This spreads the keys across the buckets evenly.
The RWMutex of the corresponding bucket is locked before writing to ensure thread safety.

**Get Operation:**
Similarly, the key is hashed to determine the bucket. 
The RWMutex is locked for reading (RLock()), allowing multiple readers but blocking writes.

**NewCache Function:**
NewCache(n int) initializes a cache with n buckets. 
It creates an array of data structs, where each struct contains an initialized map and an associated mutex.
